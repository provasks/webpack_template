# Webpack Sass / Scss compiling to separate file

Webpack is an amazing tool for transpiling and bundling JavaScript, but it can also take care of compiling Sass or Scss to static files.


I came across this issue while developing a prototype and not a single page app, that I needed to have a `.scss` file include some other files and output a `.css` file. I didn't need inlined and scoped CSS like one would probably do with a single page app.

This took me surprisingly long to figure this out, mostly because there is a lot of varying information out there and not a lot of good examples that work with the up to date versions of webpack 2 RC 4 and the ExtractTextPlugin.
